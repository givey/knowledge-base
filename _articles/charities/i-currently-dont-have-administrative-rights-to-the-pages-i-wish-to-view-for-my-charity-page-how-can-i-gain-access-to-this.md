If you don’t have access to your Charity admin page, simply:

<ol>
  <li>
    Sign up at <a href="https://www.givey.com/signup">www.givey.com/signup</a> if you haven’t already
  </li>
  <li>
    This will generate your username [the name you choose for your user profile to be recognised by, e.g. givey.com/myusername]
  </li>
  <li>
    Send this to support@givey.com along with your Charity name where we will be able to grant you this access.
  </li>
</ol>
